<h1>üó∫Ô∏è Mapty</h1>

<p>Mapty is a web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project serves as a tool to log and track your workouts on an interactive map. It incorporates advanced JavaScript concepts, including Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and asynchronous JavaScript. The LocalStorage API is employed for data persistence, allowing users to store their workout logs locally in the browser.</p>

  <p>This project was developed based on the JavaScript course by Jonathan Schemdmatan. Special thanks  for his excellent teaching and guidance throughout the course.</p>
